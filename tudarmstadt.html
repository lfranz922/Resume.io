								<h1>Virtual reality meets robotics.</h1>
                                <p>
                                    In the summer of 2022, I joined the Telecooperation lab at the Technical University of Darmstadt, where I worked on a project called HectorVR. 
									This was a joint project between TU Darmstadt's Telecooperation (HCI) lab and Hector robotics team. HectorVR allows users to remotely control 
									rescue robots through a virtual reality interface.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The application was mainly written in ROS and Unity. I worked with the VR control scheme as well as the sensor/telemetry pipeline.
									Despite being hindered by COVID restrictions, this internship was a great learning experience and served as a peek into what academic 
									research is like.
