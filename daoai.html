								<h1>3D computer vision for bin picking applications.</h1>
                                <p>
                                    From September 2021 to April 2022, I interned as a computer vision engineer at DaoAI Robotics, a then startup company that 
									utilizes 3D computer vision and deep learning to create bin picking applications. I mainly worked on developing point cloud 
									postprocessing algorithms (things like outlier removal and gap interpolation) to improve the quality of data generated by their 
									structured light 3D scanners.
                                </p>
                                <img class="image center" src="images/daoai2.png" width=80% alt="" />
                                <br>
								<p>
									I also worked on developing features such as a pseudo-color point cloud visualization mode (see above) for their camera software, DaoAI 
									Camera Studio. I also did a good amount of embedded software development and cross platform development during the development process of
									one of their new Raspberry Pi based prototypes at the time.

										I enjoyed working at DaoAI for two-ish main reasons:
										<ul>
											<li>
												<b>The technology was interesting</b>
												<p>
													This internship basically served as my introduction to computer vision. Learning about 3D reconstruction methods was super 
													interesting and I had a lot of freedom from my supervisor to work on projects that were a lot more involved than the types 
													of tickets that co-op students would normally get.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>The company was small and and the work was fast paced</b>
												<p>
													Our office space consisted of around 15 people, all of whom where software engineers. Everyone's main focus was on development, 
													which was refreshing. In retrospect, I'm really grateful that didn't have to deal with the politics that comes with 
													bigger companies.
												</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
